The proconsuladmin project provides a (currently very thin) web-based UI for managing the dataabse tables which control the behavior of a deployed Proconsul instance.  

The initial UI is exceedgingly simplistic and (imo) profoundly unsightly, but it is functional.  Time and support from some UI/UX specialists later in 2017 will hopefully yield a more pleasant presentation layer, but for the moment, the UI at least provides a better means for reviewing and managing Proconsul than manual manipulation of the database.

For the time being, the proconsuladmin tool uses explicit delegation to individual users for authorization -- authorized administrators are designated by adding their eppns (or whatever value will appear in the "remote user" value after the user authenticates) to a comma-separated list in the embedded properties file.

The latest version adds limited "partial admin" capabilities.  Users listed in the "pcadminlist" list in the properties file have full administrative access, still, but other users may be listed as "targetsystemadmins" (for the ability to define target systems), "posixadmins" (for the ability to add and edit POSIX attributes for dynamic users), and "loginadmins" (for the ability to add/delete users/groups for login access to the tool).  Access to update the DA authorization list and group assignments for target hosts or users/groups remains restricted to full admins in the "pcadminlist" list, since coupled with careful configuration in the associated AD, those rights can be used to gain administrative control over DA access."

*NOTE* that this initial version does *not* perform adequate input cleansing, so its use should be tightly restricted -- hopefully we'll be able to release an update shortly with proper XSS, CSRF, and input validation, but offering a limited tool sooner seems the better course than offering a more complete tool later.
